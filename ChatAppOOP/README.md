This Repository consists of the files that I have practiced in creating a simple project on Console based chat Application. It asks for user registration, makes the authentication in the system. The user is able to send message and view chat box. Multiple users can login and registered data and chat box message are stored and are not lost at the end of console session. The main objective of this project is to understand something different and understand the OOP concept. You are Free to take and use these projects as per your understanding need.
